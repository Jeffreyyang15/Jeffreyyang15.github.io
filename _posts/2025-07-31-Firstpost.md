# 4.1 Work Problem

1.1 Let $E=\mathbb{Q}(u)$ where $u^3-u^2+u+2=0$. Express $(u^2+u+1)(u^2-u)$ and $(u-1)^{-1}$ in the form $au^2+bu+c$ where $a,b,c\in\mathbb{Q}$.
Solution: By $u^3-u^2+u+2=0$, we have
 $u^3=u^2-u-2$.
Multiply $u$ on both sides, we have
$u^4=u^3-u^2-2u$.
Substitute $u^3$ in this equality, we have
$u^4=(u^2-u-2)-u^2-2u$, which can be simplified to
$u^4=-3u-2$.
Expand $(u^2+u+1)(u^2-u)$, we have
$u^4+u^3+u^2-u^3-u^2-u$, which can be simplified to
$u^4-u$.
Substitute $u^4$ by the previous equality, $(u^2+u+1)(u^2-u)$ is equal to 
$-4u-2$.
Factorize  $u^3-u^2+u+2$, we have 
 $u^3-u^2+u+2=(u^2+1)(u-1)+3$. 
Since $u^3-u^2+u+2=0$, we have
  $(u^2+1)(u-1)+3=0$.
Hence we have
  $1=-\frac{1}{3}(u-1)(u^2+1)$
and
  $(u-1)^{-1}=\frac{1}{3}(u^2+1)$.
1.2 Determine $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}),\mathbb{Q}]$.
Solution: We have 
  $[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}),\mathbb{Q}]=[\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3}),\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})][\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}),\mathbb{Q}]=4.$
1.3 Let $p$ be a prime and let $v\in\mathbb{C}$ satisfy $v\neq1,v^p=1$ (e.g., $v=\cos {2\pi}/p+i\sin{2\pi}/p$). Show that $[\mathbb{Q}(v):\mathbb{Q}]=p-1.$ (Hint: Use exercise 3, p.154.)
Solution: By Eisentein's criterion, the rational polynomial $x^{p-1}+x^{p-2}+\dots+x+1$ is an irreducible polynomial, and we have $v^{p-1}+v^{p-2}+\dots+v+1=0$, since $v\neq 1,v^p=1$.
Thus the degree $[\mathbb{Q}(v),\mathbb{Q}]$ equals to the degree of minimum polynomial of v, i.e., p-1.
1.4 Let $w=\cos{\pi/6}+i\sin{\pi/6}$ (in \mathbb{C} ). Note that $w^{12}=1$ but $w^r\neq1$ if $1\leq r<12$ (so $w$ is a generator of the cyclic group of 12th roots of 1). Show that $[\mathbb{Q}:\mathbb{Q}]=4$ and determine the minimum polynomial of $w$ over $\mathbb{Q}$.
Solution: We consider the polynomial
  $(x-\cos{\frac{\pi}{6}}-i\sin{\frac{\pi}{6}})(x-\cos{\frac{\pi}{6}}+i\sin{\frac{\pi}{6}})\cdot(x-\cos{\frac{5\pi}{6}}-i\sin{\frac{5\pi}{6}})(x-\cos{\frac{5\pi}{6}}+i\sin{\frac{5\pi}{6}})$ which equals to
$(x^2-\sqrt{3}x+1)(x^2+\sqrt{3}+1)=x^4-x^2+1$.
The polynomial $x^4-x^2+1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$(It is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}_2$) and thus is the minimum polynomial of $w$. Thus the degree $[\mathbb{Q}(w):\mathbb{Q}]=4$.
1.5 Let $E=F(u)$ where $u$ is algebraic of odd degree. Show that $E=F(u^2).$
Solution: We have 
  $[F(u):F]=[F(u):F(u^2)][F(u^2):F].$
The degree $[F(u):F(u^2)]$ can only be 1 or 2 because $u$ is root of the polynomial $x^2-u^2$. Since $[F(u):F]$ is odd,$[F(u):F(u^2)]=1$. Thus $F(u)=F(u^2)$.
1.6 Let $E_i,i=1,2$ be a subfiled of $K/F$ such that $[E_i:F]$ is finite. Show that if $E$ is the subfield of $K$ generated by $E_1$ and $E_2$ then $[E:F]\leq[E_1:F][E_2:F]$. 
Solution: Assume $E_2=span_F\{v_1,v_2,\dots,v_s\}$ with $s=[E_2:F]$. It holds that 
  $E=E_1(v_1,v_2,\dots,v_s)$.
Since $v_1,v_2,\dots v_s$ are algebraic over $F$, all elements in $E$ are $E_1-$linear combination of monomials $v_1^{n_1}v_2^{n_2}\cdots v_s^{n_s}$. A monomial $v_1^{n_1}v_2^{n_2}\cdots v_s^{n_s}$ is a $F-$linear combination of $v_1,v_2,\dots,v_s$. Thus an element in $E$ is a $E_1-$linear combination of $v_1,v_2,\dots,v_s$. Hence
    $[E:F]\leq[E_1:F]s=[E_1:F][E_2:F]$.
1.7 Let $E$ be an extension field of F which is algebraic over $F$ in the sense that every element of $E$ is algebraic over $F$. Show that any subring of $E/F$ is a subfield. Hence prove that any subring of finite dimensional extension field $E/F$ is a subfield.
Solution: If $u$ is algebraic over $F$, we show that the inverse of $u$ exist. This is because there exist a polynomial $g(x)$ over $F$, such that $g(u)=0$, we just need to move the constant of this polynomial to the right and times the inverse of that constant directly. Thus the subring of $E/F$ is closed under inverse operation and $E$ is a subfield.
1.8 Let $E=F(u),u$ transcendental, and let $K\neq F$ be a subfield of $E/F$. Show that $u$ is algebraic over $K$.
Solution: Since $K\neq F$, it contains an element $v$ of the form 
  $\frac{f(u)}{g(u)},\qquad deg g(x)>deg f(x), (f(x),g(x))=1$
such that $f(x)=a_mx^m+\dots+a_1x+a_0$ and $g(x)=b_nx^n+\dots+b_1x+b_0$ with $a_i,b_j\in F$. It holds that 
  $v(b_nu^n+\dots+b_1u+b_0)-a_mu^m-\dots-a_1u-a_0=0.$
Since $a_i,b_j,v\in K$, $u$ is algebraic over $K$.
1.9 Let $E$ be an extension field of the field $F$ such that 
  (i)$[E:F]<\infty$
  (ii)for any two subfields $E_1$ and $E_2$ containing $F$, either $E_1\subset E_2$ or $E_2\subset E_1$.
  Show that $E$ has a primitive element over F.
Solution: Since $[E:F]<\infty$, we have $u_1,u_2,\dots,u_r\in E$ such that
  $E=F(u_1,u_2,\dots,u_r).$
  by (ii), we can find a subfield $F(u_i)$ such that for any integer $j$ from 1 to $r$, $F(u_j)\subset F(u_i)$. For convenience, we assume $u_i$ as $u_1$. We show that $F(u_1)=E$. Since $F(u_1)$ contains all $u_j$, it is clear that $E\subset F(u_1)$. Hence we have $F(u_1)=E$.
